# Problems and Solutions

## Problem 1: Constant File Switching

Developers often open multiple files just to check a small snippet of code in an imported file, wasting time and breaking focus.

**Solution:** Hover over the import path to preview the file directly in a tooltip.

---

## Problem 2: Lack of Context in Imports

Seeing `import utils from './utils.js'` tells you nothing about what’s inside the file.

**Solution:** Add syntax-highlighted previews so developers instantly know what’s in the file.

---

## Problem 3: Slow Navigation in Large Projects

Jumping to definitions or searching for files adds delays, especially in large monorepos.

**Solution:** Configurable preview lines with quick “click-to-open” links for deeper inspection.
